Getting started :
  - Create a separate copy of the demo project (original will get overwritten during a simhub update)
  - Build
  - Set the debug target to external program and set it so simhub main exe (typically C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\SimHubWPF.exe)
  - Start ! You are ready to go !

Notes : 
  - Simhub DLL references are linked using the SIMHUB_INSTALL_PATH environement variable so they are always pointing to the latest DLLs coming with simhub, when adding new dll coming from simhub edit manually the csproj to make them point to simhub latest version using SIMHUB_INSTALL_PATH
  - A post build event copy is set to copy the dll and pdb to the simhub install directory. If you add dependencies, please make sure :
    - That they do not conflict with simhub ones
    - To add them to the post build copy
